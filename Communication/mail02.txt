Dear Richard,

In general the contours (like most of the other non-point map objects)
are represented as polygonal paths or cubic Bezier splines in 2D (in
paper coordinates). To read them directly from Mapper's XML based file
format, you could use any XML parser and extract all map objects which
have (one of) the contour symbols assigned. I think that there
unfortunately is no documentation on the map format, but it should be
relatively easy to figure out by looking at an example map file and
perhaps the relevant parts of Mapper's I/O code. If you explicitly save
a map with the extension .xmap instead of .omap, it will be saved with
more readable formatting.

To find the map objects, you could look for the <objects> tag and then
for all <object>s it contains which have the desired symbol id assigned.
Coordinates are in 1/1000 millimeters on the map if I remember
correctly, and you'd need to parse the flags correctly to determine
curves. See map_coord.h in Mapper's source for the flag values and their
meaning.

There is no necessary height information assigned to contour objects.
How do you plan to reconstruct the height field? I guess a standard
approach would be, given the contours' heights, to derive height
constraints from the contours on the height field values they cover and
use a regularizer to smoothly fill in the height values in-between.

Best regards,
Thomas

	Dear Thomas,

	I have an idea to add an 3D view possibility to the Orienteering mapper.
	For teaching purposes I would like to take an contour information from
	the map
	and try to recreate the 3D view to the landscape. Please, could you help
	me and let me know how the contours are stored in the map file?
	Would it be difficult to extract the contours data from it?
