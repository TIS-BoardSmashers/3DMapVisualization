Dear Richard,

I need to add a few things to what Thomas said:

- Files with the .xmap extension are not only formatted for humans, but
they also save the coordinates in verbose XML structures. The .omap
extension uses a much more compact text represenation for object
coordinates which needs dedicated parsing.
- There are <object> tags also in the symbols and undo/redo items. The
objects in the map are at map >  parts > objects.
- In many maps, contours are not closed, and sometimes even split in
segments for readability.
- An alternative, but less precise approach might be to generate new
contours from freely available data from the Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission (SRTM). It quite coarse (one point per 30 m), but in mountains
it is enough to get a good 3D impression, and it is possible to automate
the download of the data.

Feel free to e-mail me when you need more support.

Regards, Kai
